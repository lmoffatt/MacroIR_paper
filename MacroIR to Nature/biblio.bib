A direct extrapolation of this method to macroscopic currents is computationally prohibitive: it scales as a power of the number of channels. An approximated MLE that ignored the local time correlation of the data has been shown to provide estimates of the kinetic parameters. In this article, an improved approximated MLE that takes into account the local time correlation is proposed. This method estimates the channel kinetics using both the time course and the random fluctuations of the macroscopic current generated by a homogeneous population of ion channels under white noise. It allows arbitrary kinetic models and stimulation protocols. The application of the proposed algorithm to simulated data from a simple three-state model on nonstationary conditions showed reliable estimates of all the kinetic constants, the conductance and the number of channels, and reliable values for the standard error of those estimates. Compared to the previous approximated MLE, it reduces by a factor of 10 the amount of data needed to secure a given accuracy and it can even determine the kinetic rates in macroscopic stationary conditions.},

	abstract = {Processive molecular motors, such as kinesin, myosin, or dynein, convert chemical energy into mechanical energy by hydrolyzing ATP. The mechanical energy is used for moving in discrete steps along the cytoskeleton and carrying a molecular load. Single-molecule recordings of motor position along a substrate polymer appear as a stochastic staircase. Recordings of other single molecules, such as F1-ATPase, RNA polymerase, or topoisomerase, have the same appearance. We present a maximum likelihood algorithm that extracts the dwell time sequence from noisy data, and estimates state transition probabilities and the distribution of the motor step size. The algorithm can handle models with uniform or alternating step sizes, and reversible or irreversible kinetics. A periodic Markov model describes the repetitive chemistry of the motor, and a Kalman filter allows one to include models with variable step size and to correct for baseline drift. The data are optimized recursively and globally over single or multiple data sets, making the results objective over the full scale of the data. Local binary algorithms, such as the t-test, do not represent the behavior of the whole data set. Our method is model-based, and allows rapid testing of different models by comparing the likelihood scores. From data obtained with current technology, steps as small as 8 nm can be resolved and analyzed with our method. The kinetic consequences of the extracted dwell sequence can be further analyzed in detail. We show results from analyzing simulated and experimental kinesin and myosin motor data. The algorithm is implemented in the free QuB software.},

Ideally, a kinetic model should explain new data but also be consistent with existing knowledge. In this two-part study, we present a mathematical and computational formalism that can be used to enforce prior knowledge into kinetic models using constraints. Here, we focus on constraints that quantify the behavior of the model under certain conditions, and on constraints that enforce arbitrary parameter relationships. The penalty-based optimization mechanism described here can be used to enforce virtually any model property or behavior, including those that cannot be easily expressed through mathematical relationships. Examples include maximum open probability, use-dependent availability, and nonlinear parameter relationships. We use a simple kinetic mechanism to test multiple sets of constraints that implement linear parameter relationships and arbitrary model properties and behaviors, and we provide numerical examples. This work complements and extends the companion article, where we show how to enforce explicit linear parameter relationships. By incorporating more knowledge into the parameter estimation procedure, it is possible to obtain more realistic and robust models with greater predictive power.},

	abstract = {The gating mechanism of a single–ion channel is usually modelled by a finite–state–space continuous–time Markov chain. The patch–clamp technique enables the experimenter to record the current flowing across a single–ion channel. In practice, the current is corrupted by noise and low–pass filtering, and is sampled with a typically very short sampling interval. We present a method for performing Bayesian inference about parameters governing the underlying single–channel gating mechanism and the recording process, directly from such single–channel recordings. Our procedure uses a technique known as Markov chain Monte Carlo, which involves constructing a Markov chain whose equilibrium distribution is given by the posterior distribution of the unknown parameters given the observed data. Simulation of that Markov chain then enables the investigator to estimate the required posterior distribution. As well as providing a method of estimating the transition rates of the underlying Markov chain used to model the single–channel gating mechanism and the means and variances of open and closed conductance levels, the output from our Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations can also be used to estimate single–channel properties, such as the mean lengths of open and closed sojourn times, and to reconstruct the unobserved quantal signal which indicates whether the channel is open or closed. The theory is illustrated by several numerical examples taken mainly from the ion–channel literature.},

Some prior knowledge from other experiments can reduce significantly the number of possible models. If these models are standard statistical procedures nested like likelihood ratio testing, provide reliable selection methods. In the case of non-nested models, information criteria like AIC, BIC, etc., are used. However, it is not known if any of these criteria provide a reliable selection method and which is the best one in the context of ion channel gating. We provide an alternative approach to model selection in the case of non-nested models with an equal number of open and closed states. The models to choose from are embedded in a properly defined general model. Therefore, we circumvent the problems of model selection in the non-nested case and can apply model selection procedures for nested models.},

When Xi is true, DeltaLL is asymptotically normally distributed with predictable mean and variance that increase linearly with data length (n). When Xi(R) is true and corresponds to a distinct point in full parameter space, DeltaLL is Gamma-distributed (2DeltaLL is chi-square). However, when data generated by an l-component multiexponential distribution are fitted by l+1 components, Xi(R) corresponds to an infinite set of points in parameter space. The distribution of DeltaLL is a mixture of two components, one identically zero, the other approximated by a Gamma-distribution. This empirical distribution of DeltaLL, assuming Xi(R), allows construction of a valid log-likelihood ratio test. The log-likelihood ratio test, the Akaike information criterion, and the Schwarz criterion all produce asymmetrical Type I and II errors and inefficiently recognize Xi, when true, from short datasets. A new decision strategy, which considers both the parameter estimates and DeltaLL, yields more symmetrical errors and a larger discrimination power for small n. These observations are explained by the distributions of DeltaLL when Xi or Xi(R) is true.},

The implementation of the HJCFIT method is described; it maximises the likelihood of an entire sequence of apparent open and shut times, with the rate constants in a specified reaction mechanism as free parameters. The exact method for missed brief events is used. Several methods for testing the quality of the fit are described. The distributions of rate constants, and correlations between them, are investigated by doing sets of 1000 fits to simulated experiments. In a standard nicotinic receptor mechanism, all nine free rate constants can be estimated even from one single channel recording, as long as the two binding sites are independent, even when the number of channels in the patch is not known. The estimates of rate constants that apply to diliganded channels are robust; good estimates can be obtained even with erroneous assumptions (e.g. about the value of a fixed rate constant or the independence of sites). Rate constants that require distinction between the two sites are less robust, and require that an EC50 be specified, or that records at two concentrations be fitted simultaneously. Despite the complexity of the problem, it appears that there exist two solutions with very similar likelihoods, as in the simplest case. The hazards that result from this, and from the strong positive correlation between estimates of opening and shutting rates, are discussed.},

The method allows for arbitrary stimulation protocols, including stimuli with finite rise time, trains of ligand or voltage steps, and global fitting across different experimental conditions. The initial state occupancies can be optimized from the fit kinetics. Utilizing arbitrary stimulation protocols and using the mean and the variance of the current reduce or eliminate problems of model identifiability (Kienker, 1989). The algorithm is faster than a recent method that uses the full autocovariance matrix (Celentano and Hawkes, 2004), in part due to the analytical calculation of the likelihood gradients. We tested the method with simulated data and with real macroscopic currents from acetylcholine receptors, elicited in response to brief pulses of carbachol.

The method, referred to as covariance fitting (CVF), couples Q-matrix calculations with a maximum likelihood algorithm to fit macroscopic desensitization data directly to kinetic models. Unlike conventional sum-of-squares minimization, CVF fits both the magnitude of the recorded current and the strength of the correlations between different time points. When applied to simulated data generated using various kinetic models with up to 11 free parameters, CVF leads to reasonable parameter estimates. Coupled with the likelihood ratio test, it accurately discriminates between models with different numbers of states, discriminates between most models with the same number but a different arrangement of states, and extracts meaningful information on the relationship between the desensitized states and the phases of macroscopic desensitization. When applied to GABA(A) receptor traces (outside out patches, alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2S, 1 mM GABA, >2.5 s), a model with two open states and three desensitized states is favored. When applied to simulated data generated using a consensus model, CVF leads to reasonable parameter estimates and accurately discriminates between this and other models.},

	abstract = {A new method is described that accurately estimates kinetic constants, conductance and number of ion channels from macroscopic currents. The method uses both the time course and the strength of correlations between different time points of macroscopic currents and utilizes the property of semiseparability of covariance matrix for computationally efficient estimation of current likelihood and its gradient. The number of calculation steps scales linearly with the number of channel states as opposed to the cubic dependence in a previously described method. Together with the likelihood gradient evaluation, which is almost independent of the number of model parameters, the new approach allows evaluation of kinetic models with very complex topologies. We demonstrate applicability of the method to analysis of synaptic currents by estimating accurately rate constants of a 7-state model used to simulate GABAergic macroscopic currents.},

	Stochastic modeling of ion channel mechanisms is needed to infer the nature of the mechanism from observation of ionic currents, and to estimate the parameters involved. The models are Markov or semi-Markov processes where, typically, states are aggregated into groups with the same conductance level because we can see what level it is at, not what state it is in. 
	
	
	
	Many distributions can be obtained, such as open times or shut times, and the likelihood can be calculated for a record of sojourns at the various levels that are first extracted from observational noise. Hidden Markov methods have also been applied.

Several approaches exist for analysis of the data, including the dwell-time histogram fittings and the full maximal-likelihood approaches that fit either the idealized dwell-time sequence or more ambitiously the noisy data directly using hidden Markov modeling. Although the full maximum likelihood approaches are statistically advantageous, they can be time-consuming especially for large datasets and/or complex models. We present here an alternative approach for model-based fitting of one-dimensional and two-dimensional dwell-time histograms. To improve performance, we derived analytical expressions for the derivatives of one-dimensional and two-dimensional dwell-time distribution functions and employed the gradient-based variable metric method for fast search of optimal rate constants in a model. The algorithm also has the ability to allow for a first-order correction for the effects of missed events, global fitting across different experimental conditions, and imposition of typical constraints on rate constants including microscopic reversibility. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the performance of the algorithm, and comparisons with the full maximum likelihood fitting are discussed.},

	abstract = {The power of single-channel patch-clamp recordings is widely acknowledged among ion channel enthusiasts. The method allows observing the action of a single protein complex in real time and hence the deduction of the underlying conformational changes in the ion channel protein. Commonly, recordings are modeled using hidden Markov chains, connecting open and closed states in the experimental data with protein conformations. The rates between states denote transition probabilities that, for instance, could be modified by membrane voltage or ligand binding. Preferably, the time resolution of recordings should be in the range of microseconds or below, potentially bridging Molecular Dynamic simulations and experimental patch-clamp data. Modeling algorithms have to deal with limited recording bandwidth and a very noisy background. It was previously shown that the fit of 2-Dimensional-Dwell-Time histograms (2D-fit) with simulations is very robust in that regard. Errors introduced by the low-pass filter or noise cancel out to a certain degree when comparing experimental and simulated data. In addition, the topology of models, that is, the chain of open and closed states could be inferred from 2D-histograms. However, the 2D-fit was never applied to its full potential. The reason was the extremely time-consuming and unreliable fitting process, due to the stochastic variability in the simulations. We have now solved both issues by introducing a Message Passing Interface (MPI) allowing massive parallel computing on a High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster and obtaining ensemble solutions. With the ensembles, we have optimized the fit algorithm and demonstrated how important the ranked solutions are for difficult tasks related to a noisy background, fast gating events beyond the corner frequency of the low-pass filter and topology estimation of the underlying Markov model. The fit can reliably extract events down to a signal-to-noise ratio of one and rates up to ten times higher than the filter frequency. It is even possible to identify equivalent Markov topologies. Finally, we have shown that, by combining the objective function of the 2D-fit with the deviation of the current amplitude distributions automatic determination of the current level of the conducting state is possible. It is even possible to infer the level with an apparent current reduction due to the application of the low-pass filter. Making use of an HPC cluster, the power of 2D-Dwell-Time analysis can be used to its fullest, allowing extraction of the matching Markov model from a time series with minor input of the experimenter. Additionally, we add the benefit of estimating the reliability of the results by generating ensemble solutions.},

	abstract = {Molecular motors, such as kinesin, myosin, or dynein, convert chemical energy into mechanical energy by hydrolyzing ATP. The mechanical energy is used for moving in discrete steps along the cytoskeleton and carrying a molecular load. High resolution single molecule recordings of motor steps appear as a stochastic sequence of dwells, resembling a staircase. Staircase data can also be obtained from other molecular machines such as F1 -ATPase, RNA polymerase, or topoisomerase. We developed a maximum likelihood algorithm that estimates the rate constants between different conformational states of the protein, including motor steps. We model the motor with a periodic Markov model that reflects the repetitive chemistry of the motor step. We estimated the kinetics from the idealized dwell-sequence by numerical maximization of the likelihood function for discrete-time Markov models. This approach eliminates the need for missed event correction. The algorithm can fit kinetic models of arbitrary complexity, such as uniform or alternating step chemistry, reversible or irreversible kinetics, ATP concentration and mechanical force-dependent rates, etc. The method allows global fitting across stationary and nonstationary experimental conditions, and user-defined a priori constraints on rate constants. The algorithm was tested with simulated data, and implemented in the free QuB software.},

	abstract = {The information in a single channel record is contained in the amplitudes of the openings, the durations of the open and shut periods, and in the order in which the openings and shuttings occur. The record contains information about rates as well as about equilibria, even when the measurements are made when the system as a whole is at equilibrium. This is possible because, as with noise analysis, when the recording is made from a small number of channels the system will rarely be exactly at equilibrium at any given moment. If, for example, 50 percent of channels are open at equilibrium this means only that over a long record an individual channel will be open for 50 percent of the time; an individual channel will never be ‘50 percent open’. In this chapter we shall consider how various aspects of single channel behaviour can be predicted, on the basis of a postulated kinetic mechanism for the channel. This will allow the mechanism to be tested, by comparing the predicted behaviour with that observed in experiments. We shall also discuss the effect that the imperfect resolution of experimental records will have on such inferences.},

The new method also improves the accuracy of evaluation of unitary current as compared to the peak-scaled non-stationary fluctuation analysis, leading to a possibility to precisely estimate this important parameter from a few postsynaptic currents recorded in steady-state conditions. Estimation of unitary current with this method is robust even if postsynaptic currents are generated by receptors having different kinetic parameters, the case when peak-scaled non-stationary fluctuation analysis is not applicable. Thus, with the new method, routinely recorded postsynaptic currents could be used to study the properties of synaptic receptors in their native biochemical environment.},

	abstract = {To understand how ion channels and other proteins function at the molecular and cellular levels, one must decrypt their kinetic mechanisms. Sophisticated algorithms have been developed that can be used to extract kinetic parameters from a variety of experimental data types. However, formulating models that not only explain new data, but are also consistent with existing knowledge, remains a challenge. Here, we present a two-part study describing a mathematical and computational formalism that can be used to enforce prior knowledge into the model using constraints. In this first part, we focus on constraints that enforce explicit linear relationships involving rate constants or other model parameters. We develop a simple, linear algebra–based transformation that can be applied to enforce many types of model properties and assumptions, such as microscopic reversibility, allosteric gating, and equality and inequality parameter relationships. This transformation converts the set of linearly interdependent model parameters into a reduced set of independent parameters, which can be passed to an automated search engine for model optimization. In the companion article, we introduce a complementary method that can be used to enforce arbitrary parameter relationships and any constraints that quantify the behavior of the model under certain conditions. The procedures described in this study can, in principle, be coupled to any of the existing methods for solving molecular kinetics for ion channels or other proteins. These concepts can be used not only to enforce existing knowledge but also to formulate and test new hypotheses.},

	abstract = {Patch-clamp recording allows investigations of the gating kinetics of single ion channels. Statistical analysis of kinetic data can enhance our understanding of channel gating at a molecular level. Experimental channel records suffer from time interval omission, i. e. failure to detect brief channel openings and closings. It is important to incorporate this phenomenon into statistical analyses of ion channel data . When time interval omission is ignored, the method of maximum likelihood can usually be used to estimate gating parameters from a single channel record. However, it is far more difficult to apply this method when time interval omission is incorporated. We present an alternative approach to parameter estimation based on Poisson sampling. A simulated homogeneous Poisson process is superimposed onto the channel record and inference is based on the numbers of points in successive open and closed sojourns, rather than on the sojourn times themselves. We describe the method for the two-state Markov model C ⇌ O, although it is applicable to more general models. Computer-simulated data are used to demonstrate the efficacy of the method. Modifications of the method are discussed briefly.},

	abstract = {Discrete state Markov models have proven useful for describing the gating of single ion channels. Such models predict that the dwell-time distributions of open and closed interval durations are described by mixtures of exponential components, with the number of exponential components equal to the number of states in the kinetic gating mechanism. Although the exponential components are readily calculated (Colquhoun and Hawkes, 1982, Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. 300:1-59), there is little practical understanding of the relationship between components and states, as every rate constant in the gating mechanism contributes to each exponential component. We now resolve this problem for simple models. As a tutorial we first illustrate how the dwell-time distribution of all closed intervals arises from the sum of constituent distributions, each arising from a specific gating sequence. The contribution of constituent distributions to the exponential components is then determined, giving the relationship between components and states. Finally, the relationship between components and states is quantified by defining and calculating the linkage of components to states. The relationship between components and states is found to be both intuitive and paradoxical, depending on the ratios of the state lifetimes. Nevertheless, both the intuitive and paradoxical observations can be described within a consistent framework. The approach used here allows the exponential components to be interpreted in terms of underlying states for all possible values of the rate constants, something not previously possible.},

Different types of neurons display unique patterns of cellular excitability and assemble into brain circuits with distinct network properties. The firing properties of individual neurons and neuronal circuits, and ultimately the function of the entire nervous system, are largely determined by the kinetic properties of voltage-gated Na channels. In this chapter, I discuss how to investigate these properties (state transitions, rate constants, voltage sensitivity, etc.) by generating ion channel models and testing them in live neurons using the dynamic-clamp technique. We focus on deriving biophysically realistic models from macroscopic currents obtained in whole-cell voltage-clamp experiments, using the Markov formalism. Nevertheless, the topics covered in this chapter are also useful for investigators interested in building Hodgkin-Huxley-type models or in understanding what information can be extracted from other types of electrophysiological data. Lastly, we discuss the technical},

	abstract = {Inferring adequate kinetic schemes for ion channel gating from ensemble currents is a daunting task due to limited information in the data. We address this problem by using a parallelized Bayesian filter to specify hidden Markov models for current and fluorescence data. We demonstrate the flexibility of this algorithm by including different noise distributions. Our generalized Kalman filter outperforms both a classical Kalman filter and a rate equation approach when applied to patch-clamp data exhibiting realistic open-channel noise. The derived generalization also enables inclusion of orthogonal fluorescence data, making unidentifiable parameters identifiable and increasing the accuracy of the parameter estimates by an order of magnitude. By using Bayesian highest credibility volumes, we found that our approach, in contrast to the rate equation approach, yields a realistic quantification of uncertainty. Furthermore, the Bayesian filter delivers unbiased estimates for a wider range of data quality and identifies parameters which the rate equation approach does not identify. These results also demonstrate the power of assessing the validity of algorithms by Bayesian credibility volumes in general. Finally, we show that our Bayesian filter is more robust against errors induced by either analog filtering before analog-to-digital conversion or by limited time resolution of fluorescence data than a rate equation approach.},

	abstract = {Hidden Markov Model (HMM) inference for time-series data from ion channels or other biomolecules is challenging. We argue that inference on partially observed chemical reaction networks (CRNs) suffers from practical parameter non-identifiability (non-PI) that often goes unnoticed in maximum likelihood (ML) inferences. Limitations in the signal bandwidth and a poor signal-to-noise ratio only add to the non-PI problem. We study the role of the prior distribution in the face of non-PI. In particular, we advocate using minimally informative (MI) priors and additional restrictions on the parameter space that can be derived from physical considerations. Using patch clamp (PC) ion-channel measurements as a prototypical time series, we demonstrate Bayesian strategies for alleviating non-PI problems with sharpened prior information. In Bayesian statistics, the prior can substantially modulate the posterior. We demonstrate that non-PI can be severely harmful when using uniform priors on the rate matrix of HMMs, which are implicitly assumed in ML. We show that MI priors enable meaningful HMM inference with data whose quality can be one to two orders of magnitude worse than required to reach the same accuracy with uniform priors. However, we also demonstrate that non-PI pathologies can persist even with a prior MI. In this case, the MI prior alleviates but does not entirely resolve the problem of improper posteriors. For complex HMMs, stronger prior assumptions are needed to render the posterior proper. We propose to confine the parameters to a sampling box whose limits are physically reasonable and derived from theory. This fusion of data and physical information allows for meaningful inferences even for the most complex HMM with data of the lowest quality that we tested. However, hard theoretical limits, such as diffusion-limited binding rates, are rarely available. As an alternative, we test a vague prior on the ratios of each pair of binding rates and additionally unbinding rates, thereby softly linking them. This implicitly assumes finite cooperativity and introduces a bias towards non-cooperativity. However, in contrast to the standard practice of choosing equal chemical rates, which supposes strict non-cooperativity, this additional prior still allows for cooperativity. Despite its vagueness, our prior renders the posterior either proper in a strict sense or sufficiently proper for all data sets we considered without imposing the assumption of non-cooperativity. Hence, our approach can infer how likely different degrees of cooperativity are. Combining theoretical upper limits and vague finite cooperativity assumptions dramatically improves inferences.},

This inverse hidden Markov problem is difficult but led to the creation of a software suite called QuB utilizing likelihood optimization. This review presents the software. The software is open source and, in addition to solving kinetic models, has many generic database operations including report generation with publishable graphics, function fitting and scripting for new and repeated processing and AD/DA I/O. The core algorithms allow for constraints such as fixed rates or maintaining detailed balance in the model. All rate constants can be driven by a stimulus and the system can analyze nonstationary data. QuB also can analyze the kinetics of multichannel data where individual events cannot be discriminated, but the fitting algorithms utilize the signal variance as well as the mean to fit models. QuB can be applied to any data appropriately modeled with Markov kinetics and has been utilized to solve ion channels but also the movement of motor proteins, the sleep cycles in mice, and physics processes. Special Issue Comment: This is a review about the software QuB that can extract a model from the trajectory.

	abstract = {We propose what to our knowledge is a new technique for modeling the kinetics of voltage-gated ion channels in a functional context, in neurons or other excitable cells. The principle is to pharmacologically block the studied channel type, and to functionally replace it with dynamic clamp, on the basis of a computational model. Then, the parameters of the model are modified in real time (manually or automatically), with the objective of matching the dynamical behavior of the cell (e.g., action potential shape and spiking frequency), but also the transient and steady-state properties of the model (e.g., those derived from voltage-clamp recordings). Through this approach, one may find a model and parameter values that explain both the observed cellular dynamics and the biophysical properties of the channel. We extensively tested the method, focusing on Na(v) models. Complex Markov models (10-12 states or more) could be accurately integrated in real time at >50 kHz using the transition probability matrix, but not the explicit Euler method. The practicality of the technique was tested with experiments in raphe pacemaker neurons. Through automated real-time fitting, a Hodgkin-Huxley model could be found that reproduced well the action potential shape and the spiking frequency. Adding a virtual axonal compartment with a high density of Na(v) channels further improved the action potential shape. The computational procedure was implemented in the free QuB software, running under Microsoft Windows and featuring a friendly graphical user interface.},
