	\maketitle
	\abstract{Ligand-activated receptors are essential for cellular signaling and represent significant therapeutic targets. Among these, the P2X receptor family, activated by ATP, plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, yet the molecular mechanisms governing its activation remain inadequately understood. Here, we present a novel kinetic model that integrates structural dynamics, revealing that ATP binding induces asymmetric conformational changes in the P2X2 receptor, which lowers the energetic barrier for subunit rotation while leaving the other subunit static. We re-analyze previously published data from outside-out patch preparations of rP2X2 in response to ultra-short ATP pulses of increasing concentrations  using a novel Bayesian algorithm that leverages kinetic information from response fluctuations. This analysis reveals that agonist binding promotes rotational shifts in the UB subunit 100 to 10,000 times more  than in the LB subunit. UB subunit rotation accelerates agonist binding and delays release, whereas LB subunit rotation slows both processes. Our findings elucidate distinct roles at the subunit interfaces: the UP subunit functions as an anchor, while LB subunit rotation enhances ATP binding energy and stabilizes the receptor in its active state. Once rotated, the UP subunit shields ATP, limiting its exchangeability and further stabilizing the binding site.
		
		We anticipate that our Bayesian kinetic analysis will be instrumental in validating and refining the activation model presented here. This framework can be extended to investigate mutations, partial agonists, and other subunits. Furthermore, the notion of one subunit acting as an anchor while another serves as an allosterically active component may be applicable to other ligand-activated receptors. These insights could pave the way for developing innovative pharmaceutical agents targeting P2X receptors and related signaling pathways.

		Ligand-gated ion channels are essential for cellular signaling, with ATP-driven P2X2 receptors playing a key role in synaptic transmission. Despite their importance, the kinetic mechanisms underlying P2X2 activation remain unclear. Here, we present a novel kinetic model that incorporates structural dynamics to investigate the relationship between ATP binding and channel gating. By re-analyzing experimental data from a unique outside-out patch preparation, we show that ATP binding reduces the energetic barrier for subunit rotation, stabilizing the open state. This finding provides new insights into how molecular dynamics affect ion channel activation, bridging structural biology and kinetic modeling. Our results suggest that allosteric regulation of the forward and backward rates can modulate the transition between open and closed states, providing a framework for understanding receptor activation in a more mechanistic way. This approach opens the door to further studies that could refine our understanding of ion channel gating across different receptor types.

	\section{Introduction}
	\textbf{Comment:} The introduction should frame the problem, present the current state of knowledge, and emphasize the novelty of your work. Clearly state the gap your study fills and the objectives of your work.
	
	Ion channels are essential for cellular signaling, and their activation mechanisms are fundamental for understanding physiological processes and designing therapeutic interventions. While structural biology has provided detailed insights into the architecture of ion channels, few studies have attempted to map kinetic parameters back to structural data. Here, we address this gap by applying a novel Bayesian modeling framework to analyze the activation kinetics of P2X2, a ligand-gated ion channel. By incorporating aspects of molecular dynamics and energy landscapes, we provide new insights into the structural mechanisms that govern receptor activation.
	
	\subsection{Background}
	\textbf{Comment:} Provide context for the study, introducing the P2X2 receptor, its biological importance, and previous attempts at understanding its activation mechanism.
	
	P2X2 receptors are involved in neurotransmission and play a key role in cellular signaling. Previous studies have explored the kinetics of P2X2 activation using experimental techniques such as patch-clamp, but these studies have not directly linked kinetic data to structural information. Understanding the activation mechanism at the molecular level requires not only measuring macroscopic current responses but also considering the underlying structural changes that occur upon ligand binding and channel opening.
	
	\subsection{Research Question and Objective}
	\textbf{Comment:} Clearly define the question your study aims to address and the specific objectives.
	
	This study seeks to answer two central questions: How can we model the kinetic activation of P2X2 with high accuracy? And how can we map these kinetic parameters to structural changes in the receptor? To answer these questions, we introduce a Bayesian framework that allows us to model the activation kinetics of P2X2 receptors and explore how these kinetics relate to the receptor's energy landscape and structural dynamics.
	
	\section{Methods}
	\textbf{Comment:} In this section, explain your experimental design, data analysis methods, and the mathematical models used. Be clear about the novelty and how the Bayesian approach contributes to the analysis.
	
	\subsection{Experimental Data Re-analysis}
	\textbf{Comment:} Describe the experimental data you re-analyzed, including the specific data set from the study you referenced.
	
	The experimental data used in this study were obtained from our previous work, which provides a unique dataset for the re-analysis of P2X2 activation. These data are the only published measurements of the response of a ligand-gated ion channel to ATP pulses shorter than the channel's response time, while simultaneously recording the actual time profile of the agonist application on the same patch. This dataset is ideal for testing new kinetic models, as it provides exceptional time-resolved data that allow for accurate model fitting.
	
	\subsection{Bayesian Modeling Framework}
	\textbf{Comment:} Describe the Bayesian algorithm you used to fit the kinetic model and how it integrates with the structural analysis.
	
	We developed a novel Bayesian framework, using the MacroIR algorithm, to fit kinetic models to the experimental data. The MacroIR approach approximates the likelihood function of macroscopic currents by considering the time-averaged response over intervals, effectively converting the problem into a standard Markov process. This allows us to estimate the posterior distributions of kinetic parameters, such as the rates of channel opening and closing, and interpret these parameters in terms of the receptor's energy landscape.
	
	\subsection{Structural Insights and Energy Landscape Analysis}
	\textbf{Comment:} Explain how structural dynamics are integrated into the kinetic model and how this helps explain the energy landscape.
	
	Incorporating structural dynamics into the kinetic model allows us to analyze the energy landscape of P2X2 activation. We use a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and Bayesian inference to explore how ATP binding and channel opening affect the energy profile. The analysis reveals new insights into the energetic barriers governing subunit rotation and how these barriers influence the receptor's activation kinetics.
	
	\section{Results}
	\textbf{Comment:} Present the findings in a clear and concise manner, with visual aids (figures) to support the results.
	
	\subsection{Bayesian Inference of Kinetic Parameters}
	\textbf{Comment:} Report the results of the Bayesian model fitting, emphasizing the accuracy of the posterior distributions for kinetic parameters.
	
	We applied the Bayesian framework to the experimental data and obtained posterior distributions for the key kinetic parameters. Our results show a high degree of confidence in the estimated rates of ATP binding, channel opening, and closing. The inferred kinetic parameters are consistent with the expected behavior of P2X2, validating the model and the use of Bayesian inference in this context.
	
	\subsection{Energy Landscape and Structural Mechanisms}
	\textbf{Comment:} Discuss the results from the energy landscape analysis, highlighting any new insights into the structural mechanisms underlying receptor activation.
	
	The energy landscape analysis reveals a reduction in the activation barrier upon ATP binding, suggesting that ATP binding facilitates subunit rotation. This finding provides new structural insights into the activation mechanism of P2X2, indicating that the transition from a closed to an open state is energetically facilitated by allosteric interactions between subunits.
	
	\section{Discussion}
	\textbf{Comment:} In this section, interpret the results, discuss their implications, and highlight the novelty of your work.
	
	\subsection{Linking Kinetics to Structure}
	\textbf{Comment:} Discuss the significance of linking kinetic parameters to structural insights, emphasizing the novelty of your work in bridging these traditionally separate fields.
	
	Our work represents a significant step forward in linking kinetic modeling with structural insights. By incorporating aspects of molecular dynamics into our Bayesian framework, we have shown how changes in the kinetic parameters of P2X2 activation can be interpreted in terms of the receptor's energy landscape and structural transitions. This approach bridges the gap between kinetic and structural biology, offering a new way to study ion channel activation.
	
	\subsection{Implications for Ion Channel Pharmacology}
	\textbf{Comment:} Address the broader implications of your findings, particularly for drug development and the study of ion channels.
	
	Understanding the energy landscape of P2X2 activation provides valuable insights into how ion channels function and how they might be targeted in drug development. By improving our understanding of the activation mechanism, we can design better therapeutic strategies for modulating P2X2 receptors in various physiological contexts.
	
	\section{Conclusion}
	\textbf{Comment:} Summarize the main findings and their broader implications.
	
	This study introduces a novel Bayesian framework that bridges the gap between kinetic modeling and structural insights into P2X2 receptor activation. By linking experimental data to molecular dynamics, we provide new insights into the activation mechanism of P2X2 and highlight the potential of this approach for future studies of ion channels. Our findings have broad implications for both basic science and drug development.
